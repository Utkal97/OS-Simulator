1.Extract the file "simulator"
2.You have to replace the image paths written in the code so as to see the images.
	The required images are already provided to you(in the "src" folder), just replacethe paths as to
	where you extract the files in your system.
3.RUN "newg.java"

=====GUIDE================================================================================
1. Hover the mouse over the top left to see the menu button(Windows icon);
2. Hover over the top right to see the "shutdown".
3. There is a basic terminal which appears on clicking the button under Windows button.
4. For page replacement algorithms:
	click on 3rd button i.e., below the terminal button.
5. For Disk operation algorithms:
	click on the button with disk icon.
6. For Dining Philosophers:
	click on the button with the lock icon.
7. For process scheduling algorithms:
	click on the button with the CPU icon.
8. To see the statistics on how efficient the algorithms work on a generated input we have created a choice "RUN ALL"
   which runs all the algorithms related to it and pops out a bar-chart (see for yourself).
9. The terminal contains the following functionalities:
	type this:                            funtionaltites:
	shutdown				shuts down the whole program
	clear					clear the terminal
	cpu					open the process scheduling simulation
	ram					open the page-replacements simulation
	disk					open disk scheduling simulation
	deadlock				open dining philosophers simlation
** donot worry if "yourname/pc/" doesn't occur everytime you execute a command in terminal, just keep on giving the commands to it.
I hope you can manage from now on...
